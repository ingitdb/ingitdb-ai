# Editing Rules for This Repository

> Full details in [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md).

## This is a Documentation Repo

This repository contains planning and architecture documents only.

## Do

- Preserve existing document structure — add sections, don't reorganize
- Use relative links between documents
- Use Mermaid diagrams for architecture and flow visualization
- Use tables for structured comparisons
- Reference existing docs instead of duplicating content
- Update `docs/summary.md` when adding new deliverables
- Keep Mermaid diagrams up to date when architecture changes
- End files with a single newline

## Do Not

- Create application source code files (`.ts`, `.go`, `.js`) in this repo
- Modify `docs/openapi-spec.yaml` unless explicitly instructed
- Reorganize or rename existing documents without explicit approval
- Duplicate content that already exists in another document
- Add trailing whitespace
