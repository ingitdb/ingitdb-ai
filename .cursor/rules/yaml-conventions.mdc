# YAML & OpenAPI Conventions

## General YAML

- 2-space indentation
- UTF-8 encoding, LF line endings
- No trailing whitespace
- Files end with a single newline

## OpenAPI Specific

- Use `$ref` for reusable schemas — avoid inline duplication
- Keep endpoint paths RESTful and consistent
- Add comments for non-obvious design decisions
- Include examples for request/response bodies
- Define comprehensive error responses with status codes

## Important

- `docs/openapi-spec.yaml` is a versioned API contract
- Do NOT modify it unless explicitly instructed
- Any changes must maintain backward compatibility unless a breaking change is approved
