# Markdown Conventions

## Formatting

- Use ATX-style headers (`#`, `##`, etc.) — never underline style
- One sentence per line for clean Git diffs
- Use reference links at the bottom when a document has many links
- Maximum line length: 120 characters (soft limit)
- Files end with a single newline, no trailing whitespace

## Structure

- Use tables for structured comparisons and data
- Use Mermaid diagrams for architecture and flow visualization
- Use code blocks with language identifiers (e.g., ` ```typescript `)
- Use relative links between documents in this repo

## Content Rules

- Reference existing docs instead of duplicating content
- Preserve existing document structure — add sections, don't reorganize
- Keep Mermaid diagrams up to date when architecture changes
- Update `docs/summary.md` when adding new deliverables
